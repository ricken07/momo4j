/**
 * Interface for money transfer operations (Request to Pay / Collection).
 * <p>
 * This operation represents initiating a payment request to a customer's mobile money account.
 * The customer receives a USSD prompt on their phone to approve or decline the payment.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This is typically used for:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>E-commerce checkout payments</li>
 *   <li>Bill payments</li>
 *   <li>Service payments</li>
 *   <li>Person-to-business payments</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Example usage:</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * TransferRequest request = TransferRequest.builder()
 *     .amount("1000")
 *     .currency("XAF")
 *     .externalId("unique-transaction-id")
 *     .recipientPhoneNumber("242065551234")
 *     .description("Payment for order #12345")
 *     .build();
 *
 * TransferResponse response = client.transfer(request);
 * if (response.getStatus() == TransferStatus.PENDING) {
 *     // Wait for customer to approve on their phone
 *     // You can check status later or use webhooks
 * }
 * }</pre>
